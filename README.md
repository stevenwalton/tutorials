# Tutorials
------------
This repository is for tutorials on certain projects and software. Typically this is for things that I do not
find good documentation online and so I am creating it myself. I encourage sharing of anything here that you 
find useful. I also welcome feedback. Please open an issue if you have any improvements, requests, or concerns.

## Index:
---------
### H5:
- Contains documentation on hdf5 file formats. This will focus around use through c++, because I have found the documentation there poor.
