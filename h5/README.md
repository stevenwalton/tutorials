# H5 Tutorials
---------------
This will primarily focus around C++ code. If you are struggling with the documentation online, I hope I can help.

## getDataTypeh5 
-----------------
This code goes through how to get simple information from h5 files without the use of `h5dump`. Information here 
can be used for error checking or to load arrays dynamically and without knowing the actual size and type of 
data that is stored in the file. All you need to know are the headers.
